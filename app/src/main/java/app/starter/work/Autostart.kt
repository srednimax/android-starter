 * **This file is split out of `BatteryExemption.kt` on purpose**, which now holds only the
 * battery-optimisation half. The two are not the same kind of thing — one is a state the app can
 * read and re-read, the other is a grant it can never see — and while they shared a file named for
 * one of them, there was no way to tell the live code from the waiting code. An unused defence and a
 * working one look identical from the outside. The first app built from this template split them the
 * day its reboot-restore feature made this half live.
 *
 * [startActivitySafely] lives here rather than there because every hand-off in the app needs it.

 * them to confirm would have the app repeating the user's own guess back to them as its assurance,
 * which is that ADR's central hazard sourced from a new place.
 *
 * There is no in-app re-read either, and there never will be: `AUTO_START` is not in `cmd appops`'
 * vocabulary, and the OEM screen's own `checked` attribute reads false on granted rows. The state is
 * recoverable only host-side, by `scripts/device-gate.py` scraping that screen over `adb`. So this
 * is the case `PLAN.md` rule 4 names as the exception that proves the clause: the app still owns the
 * hand-off and still owns saying what a denial costs — a permanent row that makes no claim, never a
 * `WarningBanner`, which could not clear. What stands behind the claim that the grant matters is an
 * overnight Doze run on a real device (`scripts/doze-capture.sh`).
