 * Whether Android currently exempts this app from battery optimisation.

 * **Readable without any permission**, which is the whole reason the honest state can lean on it.
 * `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` — the permission that would let the app pop its own
 * grant dialog — is deliberately **not declared**: Play restricts it to apps whose core function is
 * the exemption itself, and `scripts/aab-permissions.py` asserts it absent from the built artifact.
 * So the app reads the state, explains it, and opens the screen where the user decides.
 *
 * Being readable is what makes this one a `WarningBanner` case rather than a permanent row — it can
 * clear itself on the resume after the user comes back. Xiaomi's autostart grant, next door in
 * `Autostart.kt`, is the opposite and gets the opposite treatment.
 *
 * Spelled the British way like the rest of this codebase; the platform's own American spelling stays
 * where the platform put it. Pick one and be consistent — a codebase with both is a codebase where
 * every call site is a guess.

/**
 * Opens Android's battery-optimisation list, where the user can exempt this app themselves.
 *
 * The app-specific action (`ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`) is the one that needs the
 * restricted permission, so this is its unrestricted sibling. Best-effort in the same shape as
 * [openAutostartSettings], and for the same reason — a dead button costs the user more than one
 * extra tap does.
 *
 * **Three destinations, and the order is a device reading rather than a preference.** The first app
 * built from this template measured that the switch governing a background schedule is Android's own
 * power allowlist — with it off the alarm still fires and `startForegroundService` throws — so the
 * allowlist is what the copy points at and it goes first. The app's own **App info** page is second
 * rather than last, because it is one tap from battery on both AOSP and HyperOS and needs no
 * permission; Settings' front door, which used to be second, leaves the user in a haystack right
 * after copy that named a specific control.
 *
 * @return whether anything opened, so the caller can say so rather than guess.
