# Optional modules — what to delete, and what breaks when you do

The template ships an app that *records things*: a Room database, photos, backup export and restore,
and reminders. Most of that is machinery with a data-loss story attached, and an app that does not
need a piece of it should delete it **before the first upload**, while deleting is free.

**Why before, and not "later, if it turns out unused".** Nothing is shipped yet, so a table deleted
today comes back at version 1 if a feature ever needs it. Ship an unused `items` table and remove it
later, and that removal is a destructive migration against real installs — the exact failure ADR-0001
exists to prevent. The same asymmetry holds for permissions: one declared today is a Data safety answer
you will have to keep defending.

The first app built from this template stored settings rather than records and deleted everything
below except the preferences on day one. It took 69 files, and five things around the code broke that
nothing had said depended on the code. This page is that strip written down, so the next one is a
checklist rather than a discovery.

## How to decide

**The test is cardinality, not subject matter.** A *fixed set* of values is settings, however many
members it has: four schedule options are settings, and seven per-day windows are fourteen settings.
What needs a table is **the user creating rows nobody knew about at build time**. No such rows, no
Room.

## The modules

Each row lists what to delete together. Delete a module, then build, then run `./gradlew test` and the
scripts in the last column — they are what tells you the strip is finished rather than the compiler.

### Room database and the schema gate

- `data/AppDatabase.kt`, `ItemDao.kt`, `ItemEntity.kt`, `ItemRepository.kt`, `Converters.kt`,
  `Migrations.kt`, `SchemaGate.kt`, `DatabasePreserve.kt`
- `work/SchemaGuard.kt`, `ui/wipe/SchemaMismatchScreen.kt`, the wipe guard's call in `MainApplication`
- `app/schemas/`, `test/…/data/SchemaGateTest.kt`, `androidTest/…/data/ItemDaoTest.kt`,
  `MigrationTest.kt`
- Gradle: the `ksp` plugin and `ksp {}` block, the three Room dependencies, `room.testing`, and the
  `androidTest` schema-assets line in `androidComponents`
- **What adapts on its own**: `scripts/project.py` reads `HAS_DATABASE` off `data/AppDatabase.kt`, so
  `schema-gate.py` passes with *"no database, nothing to gate"*, `doze-capture.sh` stops pulling a
  file that is not there, and the `mismatch` suite leaves `edge-to-edge.py` and `screenshots.py`.
- **What does not**: `docs/DOD.md`'s standing schema gate — mark it *parked*, keep the five points
  verbatim, and say it comes back the day a feature adds a table. ADR-0001 gets a dated amendment,
  not a rewrite (`docs/adr/0000-template.md`).

### Photos (the media pipeline)

- `media/MediaFiles.kt`, `androidTest/…/media/MediaFilesTest.kt`, `res/xml/file_paths.xml` and the
  `FileProvider` in the manifest
- Gradle: `coil.compose`, both `exifinterface` lines
- `scripts/aab-permissions.py`: nothing to remove — the photo path declares no permission — but
  `CAMERA` stays in FORBIDDEN, because a dependency that merges it changes the listing.
- The privacy policy's *Photos* and *camera* bullets, and `play-app-content.md`'s Data safety point 2.
- ADR-0002 gets its amendment.

### Backup export/restore, and the custom `BackupAgent`

- `data/backup/`, `ui/backup/`, `test/…/data/backup/`, `AppBackupAgent.kt` and its manifest
  attributes; `scripts/upgrade-diff.py`, which reads those backups
- `kotlinx.serialization` **stays**: Navigation 3 serialises every `NavKey`.
- **Platform Auto Backup takes over**, with `android:dataExtractionRules` if anything must stay on
  the phone. ⚠ **Every DataStore key is then backed up, whether you meant it to be or not** —
  exclusions are per *file*, and the preferences store is one file — so every key lands on the user's
  **next phone** with no code of yours involved. Ask what each key means there: a setting is welcome,
  *live state* is not ("the service should be running", "a deadline is armed"). Judge live state **at
  the read**, against something the platform never backs up — `PackageInfo.firstInstallTime` is one.
  The first app built from this template met this in its restore test: a restored "running" flag
  was acted on by a boot receiver on a phone that had never granted the permission it assumed.
- ADR-0005 gets its amendment.

### Reminders and WorkManager

- `work/ReminderSweep.kt`, `BootReceiver.kt`, `PackageReplacedReceiver.kt`, `ExactAlarms.kt`,
  `ReminderChannels.kt` and its test; `NotificationPermission.kt` if nothing else posts
- Manifest: `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, the receivers, and the
  androidx.startup `tools:node="remove"` for WorkManager's initializer (the provider itself stays —
  emoji2 registers there)
- `MainApplication`'s `Configuration.Provider`; Gradle's `work.runtime` and `work.testing`
- ⚠ **WorkManager merges three permissions your source never declares** — `WAKE_LOCK`,
  `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` — and `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` for good measure. If you
  keep a boot receiver but drop WorkManager, **declare `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` yourself first**, or the
  receiver stops being called with nothing to say so. `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` on an app with no
  `INTERNET` is a line a Play reviewer can ask about; removing WorkManager removes the question.
- `scripts/aab-permissions.py`'s EXPECTED rows for all of the above, in the same commit.
- `scripts/device-gate.py`'s `ALARM_TAG` and the exact-alarm line, if nothing schedules.
- **Settings' *Reminders* section, and the ask and banner behind it** — the `SwitchRow`, the
  `rememberNotificationPermissionAsk` call, the resumed re-read of `notificationsAllowed`, the
  `WarningBanner` and its three `settings_reminders_blocked_*` strings, plus
  `AppPreferences.remindersEnabled`. That whole block is `PLAN.md` rule 4 worked through for one
  ask; it is the shape to copy for *your* first ask, so read it before deleting it.
- ADR-0003 gets its amendment.

### The placeholder domain

- `ui/items/`, the items routes in `Navigation.kt` / `NavigationKeys.kt`, the `tab_items` strings
- `debug/…/data/SampleData.kt`, `debug/…/debug/SeedReceiver.kt`, the debug manifest's receiver, and
  the seed rows in `DebugSettings.kt` — or keep the seeding seam and point it at your own data
- **`scripts/edge-to-edge.py`'s SCENES**, `TAB_BAR`, `HOME_TAB` and `SEED_WALK`: they walk the
  template's screens. Rewrite them against yours the same week — until then the nightly job boots ten
  emulators to walk screens that do not exist and reports a red everyone learns to ignore.

## Around the code

Five places the strip reaches that no compiler will point at:

1. **`scripts/aab-permissions.py`** — EXPECTED must be exactly what the artifact carries. Run it
   against a local `bundleRelease` (or `bundleDebug`); a stale row fails the release upload, after the
   tag, which is where the first app built from this template found it.
2. **CI's instrumented job** fails on zero tests. If the strip deletes every `androidTest`, write one
   real device test — the thing the app must never get wrong is a good first one — or delete the job.
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** — the stack table, the house rules that name deleted code, and the layout block.
4. **`docs/privacy-policy.md` and `docs/play-app-content.md`**, together, in the same commit.
5. **The ADRs** — each module above names the one that gets a dated amendment. Never delete an ADR:
   the reasoning is what the next feature that wants the module back will need.
