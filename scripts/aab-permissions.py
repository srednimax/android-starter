"""Assert an AAB declares the permissions and device requirements we think it does.

    python3 scripts/aab-permissions.py [path/to/app-release.aab]

Why this exists: in the app this template was extracted from, a release note said the
app declared two permissions and the artifact declared six. WorkManager's manifest had
merged in WAKE_LOCK, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and FOREGROUND_SERVICE, none of which
appeared anywhere in that app's source. Later it happened again and bigger: a barcode
scanner dependency brought INTERNET through a transitive nobody would think to read
(com.google.android.datatransport:transport-backend-cct) — on an app whose privacy
policy said it had no network.

So the permission set is asserted against a list kept here, and adding a dependency
that merges a new one **fails** rather than passing quietly. When it does fail, the
fix is to decide what the new permission means for the Play Console, write that into
`docs/play-app-content.md`, and only then add it below.

⚠ **EXPECTED describes the template as shipped, and it is yours to rewrite.** The
first app built from this template failed its first release upload here, because the
table still listed the first app's permissions. Every row below names the file that
declares or merges it: delete a feature, delete its row in the same commit, and the
gate stays a reading of *this* app rather than of the one it was copied from.

**<uses-feature> is checked too, and it is not a lesser half.** A merged
`android.hardware.camera` at required="true" — the default when the attribute is
omitted — filters the app off every device without a camera on Play. That is a
distribution change no permission list would show, so the tool of record has to
be able to see it.

**Orientation is checked too, as a comparison rather than a ban.** A scanner library
once shipped `android:screenOrientation="portrait"` on an invisible delegate activity;
`tools:remove` takes it back out, and nothing in the app's source would show if a
dependency bump quietly put one back. The merged *text* manifest is no help either —
it keeps XML comments, so a grep there hits our own explanation of the removal.
EXPECTED_ORIENTATION names every lock this app decided on, and both directions fail:
a lock nobody decided on, and a decided lock gone missing. It was a blanket ban once,
and that is how an app built from this template tagged a release that never reached
Play — it had grown a deliberate portrait lock and the gate still asserted it had none.

`strings | grep` cannot do this job: it cannot tell a <uses-permission> from an
android:permission guard on a service, and this artifact carries three of the
latter (BIND_JOB_SERVICE, and DUMP twice) that are not requests at all. So the
protobuf gets walked properly.

Exits non-zero if the artifact's <uses-permission> set differs from EXPECTED, if it
declares a <uses-feature> not accounted for in EXPECTED_FEATURES, or if the screen
locks it carries are not exactly EXPECTED_ORIENTATION.
