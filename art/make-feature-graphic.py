"""Render the 1024x500 Play feature graphic to art/play-feature-graphic.png.

Original art only: the mark comes from `mark.py`, the same declaration the launcher icon is
generated from, so the two assets cannot drift into being different marks. Text is *rendered* with
Noto Sans, which the OFL explicitly permits without any notice — what it restricts is redistributing
glyph outlines as art.

**Play crops this graphic.** The asset is 2.048:1 and Play drops it into a 16:9 box with
`object-fit: cover` on the search-results card, so a slice of each side never reaches a viewer. It
does not look like a bug: the graphic is correct in every local preview and in the Console's own
uploader, and wrong only on the surface most people see it on. The app this template came from met
it on a live listing, and the first app built from the template reproduced it almost exactly. So the
layout is declared against the *cropped* frame — see CROP — and main() measures what it produced and
exits non-zero rather than trusting that the constants still hold.

**The colours are read out of `theme/Color.kt`**, never pasted: the palette is regenerated from seeds
by `scripts/gen_scheme.py`, and pasted inks stay the old hue on a ground that has moved — which is
exactly what happened the first time an app built from this template changed its palette.

The ground is `feature-background.png` beside this file when there is one (cover-fitted; record its
provenance in art/README.md), and otherwise a gradient between two roles of the dark scheme.
